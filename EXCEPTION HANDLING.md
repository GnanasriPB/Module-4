## EXCEPTION HANDLING

---

### AIM  
To Write a python program for solving the following error using Exception Handling.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Start the program.

2.Create an empty list L.

3.Prompt the user to enter 3 elements (can be numbers or strings) and append them to the list L.

4.Use a try block to:

Access and print the element at index 4 of list L.

5.Use an except block to catch the IndexError:

Print the message: "check index range".

6.End the program.



 PROGRAM

try:

    L=eval(input())
    
    l=len(n)
    
    if l==3:
    
        print(L)
        
except:

    print("check index range")
